1. SQL key Constraints:--> In SQL, key constraints are used to define rules related to the uniqueness and integrity of data 
within database tables.
Primary Key Constraint: Ensures that a column or set of columns uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces
both uniqueness and not allowing NULL values.Example:
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

Unique Key Constraint: Ensures that the values in a column or set of columns are unique across all rows in the table
but allows NULL values.Example:
CREATE TABLE products(
    ProductCode VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

Foreign Key Constraint: Establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity. It Ensures
that values in one table's foreign key column(s) match values in another table's primary key column(s).Example:
CREATE TABLE Customers(
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
CREATE TABLE Orders(
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID_fk INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID_fk) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

2. Save Point:--> A save point in SQL is a point within a transaction where you can save the current state of 
the transaction so that you can later roll back to that point if needed. Savepoints are typically used in database
systems that support transactions, such as relational database management systems(RDBMS). They provide a way
to divide a transaction into smaller, more manageable segments.Example:

BEGIN;

INSERT INTO Employees(EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES(101, 'Suraj', 'Meena');

SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

UPDATE Employees 
SET Slary = 55000
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

COMMIT;

3. Trigger:--> A trigger in SQL is a set of actions that are automatically performed when a specified event occurs
in a database. These events can include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other data manipulation operations on specific 
database tables. Triggers are used to enforce data integrity rules, perform logging, or automate tasks based on 
certain conditions.Example:

CREATE TRIGGER update_last_modified
AFTER UPDATE ON Employees
FOR EACH row
BEGIN
   UPDATE Employees
   SET LastModified = NOW()
   WHERE EmployeeID = NEW.EmployeeID;
END;
